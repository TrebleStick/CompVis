## Lecture 1

- Challenge of occlusion, partially seen images
- Optic appearance, RGB or grey scale

- Optic categorisation and image generation

#### Face recognition vs Object Categorisation

Face images are easier vectorised due to their alignment and orientation within the image.
General object recognition could be any orientation or alignment on the page.

###### Pose estimation
Use depth image and previous model of a hand, match potential poses (regression problem) to the hand model.

###### Image generation
Can generate fake images from labels, gender hair colour etc.

###### Activity recognition
multiclass recognition of moving images, create a pose estimation of a motion to detect what activity is being done.

###### Coursework
1st - matlab - shouldn't take too much time (lots of guidelines)
2nd - python - (more open ended)

### Visual categorisation by bag of words
notation

intra-class and inter-class variations - large variations between a type(s) within or between classes
