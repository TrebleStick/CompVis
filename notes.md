## Lecture 1

- Challenge of occlusion, partially seen images
- Optic appearance, RGB or grey scale

- Optic categorisation and image generation

#### Face recognition vs Object Categorisation

Face images are easier vectorised due to their alignment and orientation within the image.
General object recognition could be any orientation or alignment on the page.

###### Pose estimation
Use depth image and previous model of a hand, match potential poses (regression problem) to the hand model.
