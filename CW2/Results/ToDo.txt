Q2.
Changes in loss for different hyper-param:
- Effect of depth
- Effect of BN 
- Effect of Ratio

Q3.
- Inception scores over epochs
- Inception scores for different architectures
- Getting crazy inception score

Q4.
- Supplementing real with extra fake. Different amounts extra
- Replacing some portion of real with fake. Varying ratio
- Store validation loss history and plot over each other to show effect

Bonus. 
- Reversing overfitting and continuing
- Compared to different ratios on time and inception score 


To Do:
X- Store images from high inception score
X- Create new graph of best inception scores
- Compile some graphs for loss comparisons
- Add graph for inception scores from different techniques (use real data as validation)
X- Add retraining model with added images, change amount added
X- Add retraining model with ratio of total images replaced
-Graph scores of validation history (for each num size overlaying val acc?) (If I show 0,1 1,0 then can show little difference)
-Do test scores on best validation
-Try initialise training with real then fake
